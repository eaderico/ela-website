		<h3><b>About this Page:</b></h3>

		<h3><b>About Mrs. Derico:</b></h3>
		<p>My name is Elizabeth Derico, and I <strong>love</strong> teaching English Language Arts! This year is my 6th year of teaching. My favorite hobby is reading, and I love helping students develop a love of reading as well. I like to keep track of how many books I read each year, so this year we are going to have a <em>classroom reading challenge</em>! More details about this will come soon.<br>On a personal note, I am married and have five children, ages 19 (twins), 17, 14, and 12. My husband is the director of a summer camp, so I spend my summer volunteering there (and also reading, of course!). We love spending time outdoors together.</p>
